Template of a C++ service that uses [userver framework](https://github.com/userver-framework/userver).


## Download and Build

To create your own userver-based service follow the following steps:

1. Press the "Use this template button" at the top right of this GitHub page
2. Clone the service `git clone your-service-repo && cd your-service-repo && git submodule update --init`
3. Give a proper name to your service and replace all the occurrences of "social_net_service" string with that name
4. Feel free to tweak, adjust or fully rewrite the source code of your service.


## Makefile

`PRESET` is either `debug`, `release`, or if you've added custom presets in `CMakeUserPresets.json`, it
can also be `debug-custom`, `release-custom`.

* `make cmake-PRESET` - run cmake configure, update cmake options and source file lists
* `make build-PRESET` - build the service
* `make test-PRESET` - build the service and run all tests
* `make start-PRESET` - build the service, start it in testsuite environment and leave it running
* `make install-PRESET` - build the service and install it in directory set in environment `PREFIX`
* `make` or `make all` - build and run all tests in `debug` and `release` modes
* `make format` - reformat all C++ and Python sources
* `make dist-clean` - clean build files and cmake cache
* `make docker-COMMAND` - run `make COMMAND` in docker environment
* `make docker-clean-data` - stop docker containers

## Docker Deployment

For production deployment using Docker with PostgreSQL:

* `make docker-up` - start all services (app + database) in Docker containers
* `make docker-down` - stop all services
* `make docker-restart` - restart all services
* `make docker-logs` - view logs from all services
* `make docker-build-service` - rebuild the application image
* `make docker-clean-data` - remove all containers and volumes

See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for detailed documentation on Docker deployment.
